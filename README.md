Building blocks to train your own binary classifier using Scala.

[`ModelSettings.scala`](ModelSettings.scala) contains the actual construction of the neural network (using [Deeplearning4j](https://deeplearning4j.org)), the necessary hyperparameters and a few other settings.

[`ModelEvaluator.scala`](ModelEvaluator.scala) contains logic to load images, train and evaluate the model.
